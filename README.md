# digit-recognition-CNN
In this assignment we will implement a convolutional neural network (CNN). We will be building a numeric character recognition system trained on the MNIST dataset. In this assignment we will use a simple architecture based on a very popular network called the LeNet (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/726791/)
